The "Report Convo" is an innovative and powerful project that leverages cutting-edge technologies to enable natural language conversations with PDF documents. This project brings together several libraries and tools, including Streamlit, Langchain, OpenAI Embeddings and Faiss Vector Stores to create a seamless and interactive experience for users to interact with the content of PDF files.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chatbot efficiently answers questions directed to it and generates new responses each time, leveraging the capabilities of the OpenAI Chat completion API's and Embeddings. 

#### LLM Model Used:

- OpenAI API's and OpenAI Embeddings
